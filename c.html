<h2 id="heading">My C Background</h2>
<p>Prior to learning C, I had completed INFS1609, a Java based course and as such was familiar with the ideas of OOP. As a result, I was able to quickly pick up the fundamentals of C. I am currently completing COMP1511, a C based course, to learn some more advanced concepts.</p>
